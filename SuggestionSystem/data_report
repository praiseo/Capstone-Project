I would be using foursquare data as well as data from a dataset from Kaggle which includes major cities in the United States. The idea is to generate the most popular restaurant type in each city of the USA and show it to the investors.
We would use the cities data and generate the most popular restaurant type and second most popular restaurant using the foursquare data for each city and store it in a database.
Now when an investor is looking to invest into either a particular restaurant type, then he/she can enter the restaurant type and get the city names where he can start that particular type of restaurant in the USA.
To do this, I would be creating a database of most popular restaurant type in cities which would require the city data and the foursquare restaurant list and data.
